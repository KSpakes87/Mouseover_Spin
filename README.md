# Mouseover_Spin
Spin an element (ex. List Item, Paragraph, Heading, Image, etc.) when moused over, complete the rotation, and able to be fired again.
I have the script using classes. You can change the classes to your own. Copy and paste a block and change the class name to make more
or delete blocks to your need. I'm sure there is a simpler way to have just one code block and use a variable to change classes, but
I haven't tried to figure it out yet.

I spent hours trying to figure out how to do this and through endless searches I never found any help. If there is a simpler way to
do this, I never found it. If you have, please post it.
